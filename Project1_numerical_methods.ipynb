In order to do this, it is useful to compare our numerical solutions with the exact solution to the diffusion equation.

Note that you can use the exact solution to the diffusion equation in an unbounded domain in $x$ and keep in mind that the exact solution and numerical solutions will differ for later times when boundary effects are felt."

A method is first order accurate if the global error is linearly proportional to the timestep. A method is second order accurate if the global error varies quadratically with the timestep.
